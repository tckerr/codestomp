debug

executive management - just perks for other stuff, nothing big, potentially investment early on?
human relations - employee dissatisfaction, productivity
recruiting - automates hiring, building talent
development - build product
procurement - spend $$ to get stuff
marketing/sales - increase the value of customers
customer support - need more issues for this to be relevant
accounting - detailed view into finances (no actual purpose?) - tax events
IT/network/security - prevents security breaches


chopping block
   - finance, all just in accounting
   - operations - redundant (devops)
   - compliance/legal
   - facilities - may be too complicated
   - product (product is abstract so not sure about this)
   - account management - enterprise clients (what does this mean?)
   - public relations - any use?
